#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

    cout<< "How many lemons do you have?" << endl;
    cin>> lemons;
    cout<< "How many cups of sugar do you have?" << endl;
    cin>> sugar;
    
    if(lemons <= 0 || sugar <= 0){
        cout<< "You can't make lemonade!";
    }
    else
    cout<< "You're ready to sell lemonade!";
    
    return 0;
}
