Problem 4: Bulk Purchase Discount

Problem:
Customers get discounts based on how many cups they buy:
1–4 cups: No discount
5–9 cups: 10% discount
10+ cups: 20% discount
Each cup is $1.

Task:

Write a program that:
Ask how many cups the customer wants.
Calculates the total cost with the correct discount.
Outputs the final price.

Sample Input:
How many cups? 7

Sample Output:
Total cost: $6.30

CODE:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
    int cups, price = 1;
    double discount = 0.0;
    
    cout<< "How many cups do you want?" << endl;
    cin>> cups;
    
    if(cups <= 4){
        discount = 0.0;
    } else if(cups >= 5){
        discount = 0.10;
    } else if(cups >= 10){
        discount = 0.20;
    }
    double total_cost = cups * price * (1 - discount);
    
    cout<< "Total cost: $" << total_cost << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
