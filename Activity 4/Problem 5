Problem 5: Player Movement

Problem:
The player moves depending on the pressed button. Player starts at (0,0).

Task:


Write a program that:
Lets the player change coordinates depending on the button pressed.
W =  0, +1
S = 0, -1
A = -1,0
D = +1,0 

Sample Input:
W


Sample Output:
The location of the player is ( 0, 1)

CODE:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main (){
    int x = 0, y = 0;
    char move;
    
    cout<< "Enter your move. w for up, a for left, s for down, d for right." << endl;
    cin>> move;
    
    switch (move){
        case 'w':
        y += 1;
        cout<< "The location of player is ("<< x <<" , "<< y <<")";
        break;
        case 'a':
        x -= 1;
        cout<< "The location of player is ("<< x <<" , "<< y <<")";
        break;
        case 's':
        y -= 1;
        cout<< "The location of player is ("<< x <<" , "<< y <<")";
        break;
        case 'd':
        x += 1;
        cout<< "The location of player is ("<< x <<" , "<< y <<")";
        break;
        default:
        cout<< "Invalid input!" << endl;
        
    }
    
    return 0;
}
